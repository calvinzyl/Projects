It's similar to fuzzy clustering where each data point can belong to more than one subgroup or cluster, while in topic modeling one particular document can be part of multiple topics. As a type of unsupervised learning in the context of text analysis, topic models are used to discover hidden topics or groups of topics based on the text data we have, which enables us to understand the documents better and lots of times to proceed with subsequent supervised modeling procedures.\n",

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, where each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture attributable to one of the underlying set of latent topics. After pre-specifying the number of topics before deploying it, LDA returns the sorted words in each topic with respect to their probability score. "

        "The way here to ascertain the optimal number of topics in LDA is to run different LDA models with different numbers of topics, k, and see which one returns the highest coherence score. Topic coherence is defined as the measure of score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. In here the \"c_v\" coherence measure is used, which, by definition, is based on a sliding window, one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information and the cosine similarity. The higher the coherence score an LDA model returns, the more coherent, and usually the better the model is in clustering groups of topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to the elbow curve of choosing the optimal k in the context of k-means clustering, the elbow curve of LDA visualizes the trend of changing coherence score when the number of topics increases. It makes sense to pick the k with relatively higher coherence score (not necessarily the highest) but also marks an \"elbow\" turning point where the topic coherence curve starts to flatten out. If some keywords appear repetitively in multiple topics, then the LDA might allocate too many topics even if the coherence score is rather high. An optimal LDA model ideally should be both coherent and yet have distinct words in each topic it partitions."

Intuitively if our topic model assigns high probabilities to sentences that are real and syntactically correct, then we have a good model that is not \"perplexed\" by the language of the corpus. After that, the probability of the test set is normalized since the number of sentences and words vary. The lower the perplexity score is, the better the model is, because the inverse probability is taken. A perplexity score of -7.0243 and a coherence score of 0.534395 is fairly good here."

PCA is not applicable to reduce dimensions of sparse matrices vectorized from text data, but truncated SVD does not center the data before computing the SVD.
